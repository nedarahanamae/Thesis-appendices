In this repository, you can find all the Supplementary Materials of my MSc Thesis. As a biologist who cares about nature, I have decided to upload them online instead of printing them!

# R Scripts
I had Demospongiae (Phylum Porifera) sequences from Australia and I wanted to measure beta-diversity of these samples at two different geographical scales: Marine Provinces and Marine Ecoregions based on MEOW system (Spalding et al. 2007).   

Using the R programming, I aligned demosponges sequences with the ClustalW algorithm. 

Then I clustered the sequences at four different cutoff values: 0.00263, 0.00512, 0.00769, and 0.01025. 

Finally, I did some biodiversity analyzes in order to measure Jaccard and Sorensen dissimilarity indices of the samples. 

This research is my Master Thesis at the Fakult채t f체r Geowissenschaften, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit채t M체nchen.
